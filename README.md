# Slid2Print
Converts slide-based course notes into compact, ink-saving printable PDFs.

A lot of us rely on online courses or coaching platforms like Unacademy, where notes are often shared in slide format. But when it comes to printing them, the default format uses a ton of ink and paper, which makes printing and organizing them a hassle.

To solve this, I’ve built a simple Windows app that converts these slides into a print-friendly format.

### How to Use:

1. Open the software in full-screen mode.
2. Select the input files (PDFs with slides).
3. Choose an output folder.
4. Set “Pages per page” to 3.
5. Review the other available options.
6. Click **Convert**.

### What It Does:

* Optionally removes the first page (often just a title slide).
* Inverts slide colors (turns black backgrounds white to save ink).
* Combines multiple slides onto one page.
* Optionally adds slide titles.
* Outputs a single, print-optimized PDF.

Currently, it's only available for **Windows**.

The app is written in Python and bundled into an executable. While everything needed is included in the EXE, I haven’t tested it on systems that don’t have Python installed. If you’re running it without Python, I’d really appreciate your feedback on whether it works smoothly.

If it doesn’t run, you can also try installing it from the **Windows Store**.
